To solve the problem of calculating the **prefix sum** of an array \(x\) of size 8, which contains distinct elements \([2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7]\), let's explore both a **sequential algorithm** and a **parallel algorithm**. We will also calculate the number of time steps, operations, and required CPUs for each approach.

### **1. Sequential Algorithm for Prefix Sum**

The **sequential** algorithm computes the prefix sum by iterating through the array and summing the values up to the current position. Here’s the algorithm:

#### Sequential Algorithm:

Let \( x = [x_1, x_2, \dots, x_8] \) be the input array.

1. Initialize an array \( S = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] \) for storing the prefix sums.
2. Set \( S_1 = x_1 \).
3. For each \( i = 2, 3, \dots, 8 \), compute:
   \[
   S_i = S_{i-1} + x_i
   \]
4. Output the array \( S \), which contains the prefix sums.

#### Example for the input array:
Input: \( x = [2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7] \)

**Step-by-step computation**:
- \( S_1 = x_1 = 2 \)
- \( S_2 = S_1 + x_2 = 2 + 4 = 6 \)
- \( S_3 = S_2 + x_3 = 6 + 6 = 12 \)
- \( S_4 = S_3 + x_4 = 12 + 8 = 20 \)
- \( S_5 = S_4 + x_5 = 20 + 1 = 21 \)
- \( S_6 = S_5 + x_6 = 21 + 3 = 24 \)
- \( S_7 = S_6 + x_7 = 24 + 5 = 29 \)
- \( S_8 = S_7 + x_8 = 29 + 7 = 36 \)

Output: \( S = [2, 6, 12, 20, 21, 24, 29, 36] \)

#### Number of Time Steps, Operations, and CPUs for Sequential Algorithm:

- **Time Steps**: This is a simple iteration over the array, with \( n - 1 \) additions (since the first element doesn't require an addition). So, the time complexity is \( O(n) \), where \( n = 8 \).
- **Number of Operations**: Each iteration involves 1 addition, so we perform 7 additions in total.
- **Number of CPUs**: The sequential algorithm uses 1 CPU, as it’s processed one element at a time.

### **2. Parallel Algorithm for Prefix Sum**

The parallel algorithm for prefix sum can be implemented using the **binary tree method**, which is efficient and commonly used in parallel computing. This method reduces the time complexity significantly by using multiple processors in parallel.

#### Parallel Algorithm:

The key idea in the parallel approach is to compute the prefix sum in two stages: **up-sweep** and **down-sweep**.

1. **Up-sweep (Reduction)**: Compute the sum in a binary tree fashion, where each element is combined with its "partner" element in the tree.
   - Combine pairs: \( P_i = x_{2i-1} + x_{2i} \), then combine results at each level of the tree.
   
2. **Down-sweep (Distribute)**: Starting from the top of the tree, propagate the prefix sums down to the original positions.

#### Example for the input array \( x = [2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7] \):

##### **Up-sweep Phase**:
1. Combine pairs at the first level:  
   - \( P_1 = 2 + 4 = 6 \), \( P_2 = 6 + 8 = 14 \), \( P_3 = 1 + 3 = 4 \), \( P_4 = 5 + 7 = 12 \)
   
   Intermediate array after first level:  
   \([6, 14, 4, 12]\)

2. Combine pairs at the second level:  
   - \( P_5 = 6 + 14 = 20 \), \( P_6 = 4 + 12 = 16 \)
   
   Intermediate array after second level:  
   \([20, 16]\)

3. Final combination at the top level:  
   - \( P_7 = 20 + 16 = 36 \)

##### **Down-sweep Phase**:
1. Start from the top and propagate the sums downwards:
   - Set the last element of the array \( x_8 = 36 \).
   - \( x_7 = 36 - 16 = 20 \)
   - \( x_6 = 20 - 16 = 4 \)
   - \( x_5 = 4 - 12 = -8 \)
   - \( x_4 = -8 - 4 = -12 \)

   The final array \( S = [2, 6, 12, 20, 21, 24, 29, 36] \)

#### Number of Time Steps, Operations, and CPUs for Parallel Algorithm:

- **Time Steps**: In the parallel approach, the up-sweep and down-sweep phases each take \( O(\log n) \) time. Therefore, for \( n = 8 \), the time complexity is \( O(\log n) = O(3) \).
  
- **Number of Operations**: 
  - In the up-sweep phase, there are \( \log n \) levels of tree combinations, each requiring \( n/2 \), \( n/4 \), ..., operations at each level. The total number of operations is \( 2n - 2 \) additions.
  - In the down-sweep phase, there are also \( n - 1 \) operations.
  
  So the total number of operations is roughly \( 2n - 2 + (n - 1) = 3n - 3 \), which is \( 21 \) operations for \( n = 8 \).

- **Number of CPUs**: Since we can perform the operations in parallel, we would ideally use \( n / 2 \) CPUs to perform the pairwise additions at each level. This means we can use up to 4 processors in parallel to compute the prefix sum efficiently.

### **Summary Table for Both Approaches**

| **Metric**                | **Sequential Algorithm**     | **Parallel Algorithm**           |
|---------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Time Steps**             | \( O(n) = 8 \)               | \( O(\log n) = 3 \)             |
| **Number of Operations**   | 7                            | 21                               |
| **Required CPUs**          | 1                            | \( n / 2 = 4 \)                 |

### **Conclusion**

- **Sequential Algorithm**: Simple and easy to implement, but with a time complexity of \( O(n) \). This approach works well for small arrays.
- **Parallel Algorithm**: Much faster with a time complexity of \( O(\log n) \), but requires parallel hardware (4 CPUs in this case) to achieve the speedup. This is the more efficient method for large arrays, especially on parallel machines.

For small arrays like this one, the sequential approach may be sufficient, but for larger datasets, the parallel algorithm will significantly reduce computation time.

### 1. **Sequential Scalar Product of A and B (Dot Product)**

The scalar (or dot) product of two vectors \(A = [a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n]\) and \(B = [b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n]\) is calculated as:

\[
\text{Dot Product} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i \cdot b_i
\]

This is a simple summation of the pairwise product of corresponding elements in the two vectors.

#### **Sequential Algorithm:**
```python
import numpy as np

# Sequential Dot Product
def sequential_dot_product(A, B):
    result = 0
    for i in range(len(A)):
        result += A[i] * B[i]
    return result

# Example with 160 elements
n = 160
A = np.random.rand(n)
B = np.random.rand(n)

# Compute the dot product sequentially
result_sequential = sequential_dot_product(A, B)
print(f"Sequential Dot Product: {result_sequential}")
```

**Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the sequential dot product is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in each vector.

---

### 2. **Parallel Scalar Product of A and B (Using 8 Processors)**

Parallelizing the dot product using 8 processors involves splitting the work across multiple processors. Each processor computes the sum of a portion of the vector and the results are then combined.

The parallel dot product can be broken into two phases:
- **Split Phase**: Divide the vector into \(p\) chunks (where \(p = 8\)).
- **Compute Phase**: Each processor computes the dot product of its chunk.
- **Reduce Phase**: Combine the results from all processors into a final result.

#### **Parallel Algorithm:**
```python
import numpy as np
from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor

# Parallel Dot Product (using 8 processors)
def parallel_dot_product(A, B, num_processors=8):
    n = len(A)
    chunk_size = n // num_processors
    results = []

    def compute_chunk(start, end):
        partial_sum = 0
        for i in range(start, end):
            partial_sum += A[i] * B[i]
        return partial_sum

    # Step 1: Split the work across processors
    with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=num_processors) as executor:
        futures = [executor.submit(compute_chunk, i * chunk_size, (i + 1) * chunk_size) for i in range(num_processors)]
        results = [future.result() for future in futures]

    # Step 2: Sum the results from all processors
    total = sum(results)
    return total

# Example with 160 elements
n = 160
A = np.random.rand(n)
B = np.random.rand(n)

# Compute the dot product in parallel
result_parallel = parallel_dot_product(A, B, num_processors=8)
print(f"Parallel Dot Product: {result_parallel}")
```

**Time Complexity**:
- In parallel, the time complexity is reduced to \(O(n/p)\), where \(p\) is the number of processors. However, due to overhead such as splitting the work and reducing the results, the actual performance may be worse than \(O(n/p)\) in practice.

---

### 3. **Time Steps for Sequential and Parallel Processing**

To count the number of steps (operations) required for sequential and parallel processing:

- **Sequential Steps**: Each element of the vectors \(A\) and \(B\) is multiplied and then added. There are \(n\) multiplications and \(n-1\) additions. So, the total number of operations for the sequential dot product is approximately \(2n - 1\) (counting both multiplications and additions).

- **Parallel Steps**: The work is split into \(p = 8\) chunks. Each chunk requires roughly \(n/p\) multiplications and additions. The total number of operations will be \(p \times (n/p) = n\) multiplications and \(n - p\) additions. However, due to communication and synchronization overheads, this is just a rough estimate.

#### Time Complexity for Each:
- **Sequential**: \(T_{sequential} = O(n)\) steps.
- **Parallel**: \(T_{parallel} = O(n/p)\) steps (ideally), but in practice it might be a little more due to overhead.

---

### 4. **Speed-up and Efficiency**

#### **Speed-up (S₈)**:
Speed-up \(S_p\) is defined as the ratio of the time taken by the sequential execution to the time taken by the parallel execution:

\[
S_p = \frac{T_{\text{sequential}}}{T_{\text{parallel}}}
\]

For 8 processors, assuming ideal scaling (i.e., no overhead):

\[
S_8 = \frac{T_{\text{sequential}}}{T_{\text{parallel}}} = \frac{n}{n/8} = 8
\]

#### **Efficiency (E₈)**:
Efficiency \(E_p\) measures how effectively the processors are being used:

\[
E_p = \frac{S_p}{p} = \frac{8}{8} = 1 \quad \text{(ideal efficiency)}
\]

In practice, the efficiency will be lower due to communication overhead and load imbalance.

---

### 5. **Generalizing Speed-up and Efficiency**

- **Speed-up \(S_p\)**:
  \[
  S_p = \frac{T_{\text{sequential}}}{T_{\text{parallel}}} = \frac{n}{n/p} = p
  \]

  This is the ideal case. In practice, the speed-up will be less than this due to overhead, but the formula gives an upper bound.

- **Efficiency \(E_p\)**:
  \[
  E_p = \frac{S_p}{p} = \frac{p}{p} = 1
  \]

  Again, in practice, \(E_p\) will be less than 1, but ideally, the efficiency would be 1 if the work is evenly distributed and there is no overhead.

---

### Summary of Key Points:

1. **Sequential Algorithm**: Simple loop, time complexity \(O(n)\).
2. **Parallel Algorithm**: Divides the work among 8 processors. Each processor works on a subset of the vector, and the results are reduced. Ideal time complexity is \(O(n/p)\), but practical efficiency will be lower due to overhead.
3. **Speed-up**: Ideal speed-up for 8 processors is 8, but overhead will reduce this.
4. **Efficiency**: Ideal efficiency for 8 processors is 1, but overhead reduces this in practice.
5. **Generalized Functions**:
   - Speed-up \(S_p = p\) (ideal).
   - Efficiency \(E_p = 1\) (ideal).

If you were to run the actual code, the performance will depend on the hardware, and you may find that the parallel approach doesn't achieve the ideal speed-up due to overhead.
